# GPiD Framework

Generic implicate generator using decomposition algorithms.

# Dependencies

 - Minisat is downloaded, patched and built inside the library. It needs not be installed.
 - CVC4 has to be installed.
 - Z3 has to be installed, Z3 cmake binder has to be installed too. Depending on the OS, ```LD-LIBRARY-PATH``` may need to be updated as well.

# Configuring

Configure the library using cmake with the following options available.

 - ```-DBUILD_DOC``` : Generate rules for creating a doxygen documentation.
 - ```-DBUILD_TESTS``` : Generate rules for building and executing tests. Uses the google-test framework.
 - ```-DCOVERAGE_TOOLS``` : Generate rules for executing coverage analysis.
 - ```-DUSE_COLORS``` : Use colored messages in the library. Deactivated on Windows.
 - ```-DTRUE_SOLVER_INTERFACE``` : Configure and build a decomposition engine interface for the true solver.
 - ```-DMINISAT_SOLVER_INTERFACE``` : Configure and build a propositional decomposition engine interface for minisat.
 - ```-DCVC4_SOLVER_INTERFACE``` : Configure and build a smt decomposition engine interface for CVC4.
 - ```-DZ3_SOLVER_INTERFACE``` : Configure and build a smt decomposition engine interface for Z3.
 - ```-DMERGE_MINISAT_WRAPPERS``` : Merge minisat contents wrappers inside its original namespace.

The library and associated executable example can then be built using the builder generated by cmake.

# Usage

```./bin/gpid-gts -i <file> -g <generator>```
